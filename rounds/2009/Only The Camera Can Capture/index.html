				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	That must have taken ages!  It&#39;s a very inventive image and it&#39;s obviously good, so top marks for that, but I think it verges more towards &#39;what Photoshop can capture&#39; to score that highly on the theme.

Another great picture using a simple idea. There are some places where the cloning hasn&#39;t quite worked and there&#39;s a lack of shadow, but these are minor. A great shot.

Truly stunning! A little obscure on the theme and a few noticeable clone marks. One of the most creative shots here.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	I think the only thing that really spoils this shot for me is the processed lens flare.  A slight boost of contrast and shadows would give some colour and definition to the foreground.

The classic water drop image, very well executed with good sharpness and a nice catch light.

The only criticism here is the small light flare that spoils the pure shape of the water drop.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Very little to say about this one - cracking idea and equally well executed.
This is lit well, to contrast the darkness of the hands against the brightness of the water.

Not much to say here, other than it&#39;s a great idea. I maybe would have chosen a shot that shows the water more in the shape of the balloon, as it&#39;s not immediately obvious what&#39;s happened to create this shot. 

My only criticism is that it would have looked more effective a few frame earlier as the balloon shrunk away.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Good capture.  Composition and exposure are nice; my only thought would be that I might have increased the saturation a bit.

The slight asymmetry of the wheel is the only thing that&#39;s a little distracting about this. Otherwise, it&#39;s a great example of a long-shutter speed image with a really good subject and interesting colours.

It’s a shame about the tree bottom left but that isn’t your fault, so a well composed and captured shot. Maybe worth a try from another angle to get some interest in the foreground.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Fun idea and nicely done.  Not much to comment on really.  I suppose a small point would be that the top of the burglar’s head is cut off, but it&#39;s a non-issue for me.

I love this – it&#39;s taken a nice idea and been really creative with it. It fits the theme perfectly, and it&#39;s a shame that the top was cropped off slightly.

A little to tight on the crop, but a real fun take on the theme.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Fantastic shot.  I like the fact that you can see the other platform towards the front still - you&#39;ve caught that just right.  My only nitpick would be the WB - there&#39;s a yellow cast to it all.

I really like this shot, mainly because the detail on the static parts of the image are very sharp and precise. It&#39;s been framed so that there&#39;s a nice contrast between the straight lines of the wiring and the platform and the more fluid motion of the train. Overall, it works well. I&#39;d have maybe gone for a tighter aperture and longer shutter speed to peak out the flares on the lights, but that&#39;s only minor

A really nice idea well captured in good time, the composition works really well with the distant vanishing point. A slight yellow cast that can be removed with some white balance adjustment.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Excellent capture with good relevance.  My main thought is on the sharpness - it could really benefit from an USM - though apart from that it&#39;s well processed.

A great image, let down ever so slightly by the blurring on the head. I think playing around with the levels gives a colour mix that I prefer, but this is a hugely personal area, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with the levels chosen.

A stunning picture! If a little soft in places but capturing that sort of motion is hard. Personally it could have a bit more contrast, as it looks a little flat for such a striking shot.</p>

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Excellent shot and processing.  I don&#39;t have much to say about it - it&#39;s working well for me.

A great use of the tilt-shift effect to make a reasonable image really stand out. This has been done really well with the model effect coming through very strongly. Added to the good composition and lighting of the main subject, it all makes an excellent image. I&#39;m marking the theme down though, because this effect has been mainly achieve as the result of post-processing, rather than what the camera has captured.

A grand shot well captured, but the line of focus seems a little odd to me, I cannot quite make out where it begins and ends.

An unconventional shot, but very well executed. Not a lot to say about this, but it really does reflect the theme as well as being well composed, lit and coloured.

I am off the mind its more what Photoshop can capture rather than the camera, but it is very well executed and can’t be faulted in technique.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Infrared is great theme-wise, but I feel the image lacks something.  Whether it&#39;s the subject or the processing, I don&#39;t know, but it feels quite flat.  You&#39;ve also clipped some of the clouds.

A really nice subtle use of IR to get an image that certainly strikes as being different. Despite the subject not being the most interesting, the IR effect has really helped to provide enough interest in a fairly standard countryside scene.

A nice composition with interest from the view down the road, a well-captured IR image could use some contrast boost.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Excellent shot - not an easy one to get.  A bit of selective sharpening would benefit around the head and just some general processing to give it some punch and bring the exposure up a bit - it&#39;s quite underexposed.

I did stare at this for a while wondering what it was, and when I figured it out I can see the idea behind it. I&#39;m not all together sure it works, as there just isn&#39;t enough sharpness and colour contrast to provide hits to the viewer what they&#39;re meant to be looking at.

An amazing picture that is only let down marginally by its softness but it really captures the fluid motion of the birds flight.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Good shot.  There&#39;s a clear link to the theme and it works well.  It&#39;s nice and sharp and I like the use of DoF.

A really nice wildlife image here, with great composition and colour. The noise in this case is probably a little distracting, but everything else works really well.

Really well composed shot but the heavy noise almost makes the bird look a little soft, a boost in brightness could bring out some of the colours to.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Now that&#39;s different and kudos for making it happen.  I&#39;m not sure about the immediate foreground and I think the composition could have been better, but top marks for the concept.

As an abstract, this is quite nice. The noise and lighting are interesting and lets the viewer figure out what they&#39;re looking at. However, I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s a good fit for this theme.

A very different take on the theme, which works once you, have worked out what it is you’re seeing.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Nice idea, but the brightness in the sky kills it for me.  Back to back exposures of 30s layered using lighten in PS would give the star trails but keep the sky dark.

A really simple idea, which has produced a good image. My only to criticisms would be that it&#39;d be nice to have slightly longer trails, and that the yellow is a bit overpowering. Tweaking the colours to something a bit darker may have helped.

A play with the white balance and a longer exposure would really add to this shot with some more noticeable light trails.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Fun image.  I like the colours and the movement you&#39;ve captured in the lights, but I&#39;d have preferred the people to be more static.  A burst of flash would have helped freeze the people whilst giving you the same light trails.

Another simple idea, which has been well done. The issue with light-trail images is that they&#39;re so common there needs to be something that makes it stand out further. I think this just lacks that extra impact factor which something a bit more creative could have provided.

A simple and effective choice for the theme but I find the figures in the frame spoil the impact of the light trails.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Nice image - fits the theme well and works nicely.  Personally I&#39;d be tempted to increase the contrast and bring out the colours a bit to give it a bit more punch.

A classic light trails shot, with a good light variation and use of a small aperture to get the effects on the lights. Not mind-blowing, but certainly a good shot

Simple and affective choice for the theme, well executed. The white balance could do with some tweaking to get rid of the yellow cast to the lights and bring them nearer to white.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	It&#39;s a nice shot, but it lacks an obvious focal point and I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a fan of the pinky-orange sky.  The movement in the leaves is captured nicely.

A very simple idea, but executed very well. The composition and use of a long shutter speed adds a very nice mood to both the foreground and the sky / branches.

I like this has a very eerie atmosphere and all the detail and strong colours distract the viewer from the overall lack of a focus point.</p>

Nicely composed, and well lit make this a good start. My only complaint is that the drops were captured more sharply using a faster shutter speed. Other than that, it&#39;s well done.

There is nothing technically wrong with this picture, but if the pour is meant to be the point of capture it should be more in focus.

A slightly unusual take on the traditional water freeze shot, this idea works. I&#39;m not sure if it may have benefitted from being more symmetrical, or if the asymmetry adds to it&#39;s realism. In any case, it&#39;s reasonably lit, with only the off-white reflection on the glass being a slight distraction.

Well composed and thought out but background distracts from the purity of the water.

My only problem is it doesn&#39;t fit the theme as well as a lot of the other images - apart from DoF, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s &#39;only the camera can capture&#39;.
There&#39;s loads to like about this, the great contrast, the noise, the composition, the sharpness. A great picture, but not as relevant to the theme as other entries.

No real critique necessary but its lack in connection to the theme.

A simple macro, it&#39;s well lit and composed, but I&#39;m not sure how it relates to the theme. It&#39;s a good image otherwise.

It is just a macros of a leaf with good strong colours and detail but there is nothing more to it than this really, more interest could have been achieved if we were able to zoom in again more towards a microscopic level.</p>

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Like it - good link to the theme.  Well captured.

An unusual perspective with some manipulation afterwards. It&#39;s an interesting shot, but the masking of the bulb could be a little better, and the overall composition is a little wonky.

It’s a good interpretation of the theme, but I would say a better composition is needed the choice of bulb and shade don’t do the idea justice.

A nice, but fairly bland shot. It&#39;s well composed, lit and balanced, but just seems to lack that extra interest factor.

Fits the theme, nice colours and well composed but lacks some interest.</p>

An interesting crop was taken here. The aspect ratio feels a little constricted, but overall the effect is well captured with good sharpness on the in-focus bits.

It’s a challenge to see the focus of the image but it does mildly meet the theme criteria.

It&#39;s a good idea, but there&#39;s no real focal point for this, which means the viewer feels slightly lost and not knowing what to look at.

The radial blur effect has ruined this shot, it has taken away any form of picture that may have been present all that is left is a mess.

A very high-contrast shot that has real punch and impact. The highlight reflections in the bottom left are a little distracting, but otherwise a good shot.

Technically this shot is lacking there isn’t enough of a zoom to be a macros detail and its not composed to catch the fluid motion of the water. It is just a shot of the tap.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	I get the feeling this shot could be so much better if you&#39;d just put a bit more effort into it.  The background isn&#39;t ideal and is distracting; the lighting isn&#39;t great and is giving random shadows.  Maybe a shorter exposure would have made the second hand stand out a bit more - something like 10s.  The idea is there, though.

A good idea, but with a lot more that could have been done. The use of regular light flashes could have made the second hand stand out far clearer, and prevented the blurring of the minute hand.

Its difficult to find the theme connection but once you do it makes it more apparent that there is room for significant improvement, a change of exposure to bring out the second hands movement and a tighter crop to give it more significance.

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Rotation, rotation, rotation.  Yeah, it&#39;s a bit squiffy, which is putting me off.  A bit of a play with the levels can make it a bit punchier without too much hassle.  Nice idea, though.

My main issue with this shot is that it doesn&#39;t feel straight. Indeed, the top step isn&#39;t, but the other steps are, so I&#39;m not sure what gives it this feel. It&#39;s also fairly tightly cropped, and would benefit hugely from being able to see more of the shadow. Other than that, a nice idea well executed.

Zoom out a little to get some more scene interest, and some straightening is needed and to give it that extra punch have a tweak of the levels and contrast.</p>

				<p class="comments" style="white-space: pre-line;">	Good idea.  There&#39;s not a massive amount to say about it technically - maybe a slight contrast and shadows boost to give the lava a bit more definition?

One of those that takes a little while to figure out what it is. It&#39;s a good idea, but it&#39;s overexposed leading to large parts of white. Adjusting the levels to get more contrast on within the green would have helped add impact.

A little over exposed so some blown parts and not really a strong contender for only the “camera” can capture.</p>

This is another image that lacks a real central point. I can see the idea behind it, but I&#39;m not sure it works to well to give a good impact.

Nice composure and colours giving a good image that draws the viewer in wanting to know more about what it is they are seeing but it doesn’t quite delivery once you see past the colours its just a simple snap.

I&#39;d prefer it if the wind chime wasn&#39;t so close to the edge and if you had all the bricks straight.  I know this is a perspective thing, but I think it detracts.

Another image where it&#39;s not clear what it&#39;s meant to be. The composition is a bit off, with the subject falling out of the right of the image.

Id say it hasn’t quite worked out as the intended capture, with the composition letting it down also. The scene also is a little lacking in interest with just the bricks to count.
